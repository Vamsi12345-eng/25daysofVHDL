I've always felt, if both V.H.D.L and VERILOG are both hardware descriptive languages!!!

why would a person need to learn both???


Atleast not to learn both, a person should master in one and should have idea on what's going on other thing. In industry point of view it will make communication more easier. For sake, let's take two members in team who's working on same design and one master in verilog and another master is V.H.D.L, having an idea on other language will make communication more easier.


So thought, it's high time to get familiar with V.H.D.L. and always believed practice is the only option for anything!

whatever I've done previously on #100daysofRTL with verilog. Will replicate that to do with V.H.D.L.

Let's make it #25daysofVHDL. Interested persons can join the trend, with the above mentioned hashtag!
